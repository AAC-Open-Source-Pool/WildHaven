<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p> 
               WildHaven is a mobile application designed to support wildlife sanctuaries in India by facilitating adoption, donation, and volunteer opportunities. With India’s rich biodiversity and growing public interest in wildlife conservation, the app connects users—including environmental activists, nature enthusiasts, tourists, and volunteers—with zoological parks and sanctuaries, enabling them to contribute to conservation efforts. Through the app, users can adopt animals, make donations, track conservation projects, and find volunteer opportunities, fostering greater public involvement in wildlife protection. By bridging the gap between users and wildlife institutions, WildHaven aims to inspire ongoing support and active participation in the preservation of India’s unique wildlife.
